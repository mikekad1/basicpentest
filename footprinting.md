1.	To begin scanning senecacollege.ca I used “whois” and received following information:
  * Domain name: senecacollege.ca
  * Domain status: clientUpdateProhibited https://icann.org/app#clientUpdateProhibited 
  * Creation date: 2000-11-08T22:44:46Z
  * Administrative contact:
```

Name: SenecaCollege of Applied Arts & Technology (Ontario)       
Address: 1750 Finch Ave. East / Toronto / Ontario / M2J 2X5 / CA 
Phone: (416) 491-5050                                            
Email: admin.dataservices@senecacollege.ca                       

```

2.	Next, I decided to utilize both “dig” and “nslookup”, with somewhat similar results:
  * Name servers: ns1.d-zone.ca / ns2.d-zone.ca
3.	After gathering that information, I decided to try all of other methods described in the module, for example “host” :
  * Addresses 34.243.56.93 / 52.60.173.6 / 52.24.251.32
  * Mail handled by: senecacollege-ca.mail.protection.outlook.com
4.	The abundance information gave me MALTEGO with extra name server:
```
  Nhddi0.senecacollege.ca , persons (Ciccio, Pidora, Kevin Lo, Adam Norman, Craig Barretto, Michael Martin, Catlin Potter)...
```
 - each person with a list of emails and association worth weeks to explore.
Website also had 24 snapshots, 33 DNS name entities, 13 documents, 13 domain entities, 26 email addresses and 12 website entities.
5.	Lastly, I used Google Dorking, to try and see if I find anything Confidential or less obvious and came across some interesting info, like …

This concluded my Footprinting analysis, although more could be deducted from users, and affiliations, files, I decided to limit it due to time constraints.
