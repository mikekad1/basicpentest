So for this project I followed these steps:

1. Downloaded and built AFL (see Log), the current version was used (2.52b). 
2. Copied asdf file from GitHub page and ensured the contents are identical to the code in demonstrated in the book. 
3. While there WAS an error at the time of compiling due to comments, removed them and added back after compiling was finished. 
4. Created input/ directory with a file that has 8 “a’s”. To make sure that it’s correct – copied from textbook. 
5. Started fuzzing with AFL (with @@ and later without to see different results) ->

6. No crashes were observed, one of attempts ran all night. According to the book, AFL looks for crashes at random locations and might take years… (not sure if it is my case here) 
7. Log attached demonstrates steps taken, and that the hardware is matching. VM runs Bridged Network mode -> and is operational.
