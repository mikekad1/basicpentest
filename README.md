To discover what subnet is being used for computers on my network , I am going to use ip r.

This gives me information needed to run nmap and find other machines on my local network.

To do so I am going to run nmap 192.168.2.0/24 and find the address of machine I am going to attack.

Now that I have the IP’s, it is time to scan the ports of my target  for vulnerabilities. I will use nmap once again with the command nmap -A 192.168.2.18 . 
This is an aggressive scan that will give me more information that I might be able to use later.

Earlier we found an http port 80 open, that means we can go ahead and open the address in our browser to inspect it.

This works. But there is no content on the page.

To inspect web server for hidden directories, I am going to use nikto.

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192116](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/c62618a3-0a42-4b43-89d2-1cf60770bb68)

By using command nikto -h 192.168.2.12 , I got some extra information. There is a directory /secret/ to explore.  
This information could be useful. I decided to head to /secret/ directory of this server. Note that other links point to ‘vtcsec’ server. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192205](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/bcc17c2a-2de2-4ab8-935c-a3ffb99b2d20)

The page does not look correct… seems like no assets are loading and links lead to nowhere…Quick search for solution, shows that we need to add vtcsec to our /etc/hosts/ file to be able to load the page properly.

Note: this has to be done with root 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192310](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/72abf236-8b53-45cc-8dfe-db1280522a5c)

The site should now load properly. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192337](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/d46ff7cb-0bcc-4b83-97de-8d5ad23373c9)

From there on, we could try to log into the site using Dictionary attack by searching the most common or default admin credentials for Wordpress.

We’re in! 
To get root access to machine, I am going to need to use some of the new tools. 
I am going to install Metasploit and experiment using it. It is known for finding known vulnerabilities that we could exploit. 
Particularly exploit – as a piece of code that will grant us escalated privileges to the system. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192534](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/ff2e8488-22fa-46d8-a74b-0db3a96caff4)

With Metasploit installed, we can now refer to our earlier results from Enumeration: We have ProFTPD and OpenSSH protocols to explore! 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192626](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/c6aff480-2609-404b-9509-2727d9591622)

I decided to explore ProFTPD vulnerabilities… ‘backdoor’ seemed interesting – and it is even being recommended below. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192702](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/87fdc411-1d2e-48ae-af16-435dc9634180)

Next, I viewed options for this exploit. Right away I can see that I need to set target’s IP address. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192731](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/f0b10ca8-9a95-4b3d-8e12-fe88820484fd)

We can’t execute just yet. That’s why I needed to view payloads. I needed a ‘reverse TCP’ payload to gain root access…and there is one! 

![Screenshot 2024-03-25 192813](https://github.com/mikekad1/basicpentest/assets/62948569/61220b45-1333-446a-b4f7-544aeac726d3)

After checking options, I needed to specify the address of my attacking machine…

Here, I executed a code: 

python3 -c ‘import pty;pty.spawn(“/bin/bash”)’ 

and got root access!

I checked etc directory for shadow file and opened it. Immediately, I noticed ‘marlinspike’ hash.

[note: my laptop started seriously lagging, so I had to take a photo instead of screenshots] 
As shown above, I found that the best tool to crack hashed passwords is John The Ripper. With password cracked and shown, I am finally in.

It’s HACKED!
