Additional results for Asix Electronics using nbtscan revealed information that it runs two services, NetBIOS suffixes of which mean Default name registered by a client computer and browser clients and servers in the group.
Also Sagecom Broadband SAS, produced NetBIOS suffixes for services that translated to Default name registered by a client computer, Default name registered by a server computer, Browser service elections, Master browser.
